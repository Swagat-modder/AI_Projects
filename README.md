## Text Completion Using Fine-Tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs)

# Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook demonstrating how to fine-tune a pre-trained language model (DistilGPT-2) for text completion tasks using a subset of the IMDb movie reviews dataset. The notebook covers data loading, preprocessing, tokenization, model fine-tuning with Hugging Face's Transformers library, and basic inference for generating text.
The goal is to adapt the model to generate text in a style similar to IMDb reviews by fine-tuning on causal language modeling (predicting the next word in a sequence). This serves as an introductory example of LLM fine-tuning for domain-specific text generation.

# Key Concepts

Fine-Tuning: Adapting a pre-trained LLM (DistilGPT-2) to a specific dataset/task.
Dataset: A small sample (1%) of the IMDb reviews dataset from Hugging Face Datasets.
Model: DistilGPT-2, a lightweight version of GPT-2 suitable for resource-constrained environments.
Task: Causal language modeling for text completion/generation.

# Requirements
To run the notebook, you'll need:

Python 3.8+
Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab (the notebook is optimized for Colab with GPU support)

# Dependencies
Install the required libraries using pip:
pip install transformers datasets torch

# Usage

1.Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/text-completion-fine-tuning-llms.git
cd text-completion-fine-tuning-llms

2.Open the Notebook:
Use Jupyter: jupyter notebook Text_Completion_(Using_Fine_tuning_of_LLMs).ipynb
Or upload to Google Colab for free GPU access.

3.Run the Notebook:
Execute cells sequentially.
The notebook loads a small subset of data to keep training quick (1 epoch on 200 samples ~20-30 seconds on GPU).
Fine-tuning saves the model to ./fine_tuned_model.
Test generation with a custom prompt (e.g., "This is a prompt") at the end.

4.Customization:
Increase dataset size: Change data=load_dataset('imdb',split='train[:1%]') to a higher percentage (e.g., train[:10%]).
Adjust hyperparameters: Modify TrainingArguments for more epochs, larger batch sizes, etc.
Use a different model: Replace "distilgpt2" with another causal LM like "gpt2".



# Example Output
After fine-tuning, generating text from the prompt "This is a prompt" might produce something like:
textThis is a prompt to ask for help. I have no idea what the answer is. I have
(Note: Outputs vary based on random seeds and training.)

# Notebook Structure
Step 1: Install dependencies.
Step 2: Load and sample IMDb dataset.
Step 3: Preprocess text (replace newlines).
Step 4: Load tokenizer and model.
Step 5: Tokenize data and set labels.
Step 6: Configure training arguments.
Step 7: Split data into train/eval sets.
Step 8: Set up Trainer and fine-tune.
Step 9: Save and test the model.
Additional Notes: Explanation of fine-tuning benefits.

# Results
Training Loss (example): ~4.01 after 1 epoch.
The model learns IMDb-style text patterns but may overfit/underfit on small data. For better results, use more data/epochs.


# Limitations
Uses a tiny dataset subset for demo purposesâ€”scale up for production.
No advanced techniques like PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning) or quantization.
Requires GPU for efficient training (Colab provides free T4 GPUs).
